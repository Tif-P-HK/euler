## A Journey Thru Project Euler
This repo is a log book of my work on successfully solving (or struggling to solve, or failed to solve) [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)'s problems. 

As a side project, I am also revisiting and cleaning up the code I wrote some years back, when my coding skill was a lot worse and the code was a lot more messy.

This code is provided as-is and is meant for my own record. However, if you find any part of it valuable and helpful, I'd appreciate it if you could provide attribution back to me.
